People's photographs and videos have risen as a result of the widespread use of digital photography, particularly from smart phones. Simultaneously, people are less likely to erase photos or videos they shoot as they have plenty of storage space. As a result, finding photos and videos becomes more difficult. Genealogy is well-known for finding and monitoring family links, but it lacks strong linkages to today's larger collections of photographs or to previously stored photographs that are now being digitized.

The aim of the project is to build a system that connects family tree information with the archive of pictures and metadata of the pictures.
